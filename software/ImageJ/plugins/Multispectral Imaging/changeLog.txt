Big update:

Support for non-linear images
The cone mapping model generation now uses the JAMA library to make the models
so no dependence on R.

______________________________________________________________________________
--------------------------------11/2/2015 -----------------------------------
Colour JND difference calculator added to go with pattern & lum measurements.
Lots of little bug fixes and neatenning of dialog boxes

--------------------------------5/1/2015 -----------------------------------
Bug fixed where importing slice labes had a limit of 4 grey standards.

--------------------------------19/12/2014 -----------------------------------

Patter & luminance distribution difference calculator fixed to work with new
output that produces multiple tables.

--------------------------------4/12/2014 -----------------------------------

Added manual alignment option for when auto-align doesn't work reliably.
This was most common when images didn't have much detail for the alignment
to work with. In future it might be good to add manual scaling to this
function.

The options window for generating multispec images was too big for some
screens, so I've simplified it.

I've reduced the number of output options so that they're all 32-bit (people
shouldn't work with anything else), and alignment checking has been added.

The pseudo-uv output and visible output should make reviewing images and
selecting ROIs on dark images easier.

Image-changed flag rest on each multispectral image load, so the save image
dialog won't come up.

Bug fix in renaming RAW files.

Batch image analysis output changed from all being squeezed onto the same
big results table (with lots of zeros in the spaces), to separate results
tables for summary data, pattern spectra and luminance distributions. I still
need to add tools to analyse these results easily in one...
