Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Digital cameras can be powerful tools for measuring colours and patterns in a
huge range of disciplines. However, in normal 'uncalibrated' digital photographs 
the pixel values do not scale linearly with the amount of light measured by the 
sensor. This means that pixel values cannot be reliably compared between
different photos or even regions within the same photo unless the images are 
calibrated to be linear and have any lighting changes controlled for. Some 
scientists are aware of these issues, but lack convenient, user-friendly software 
to work with calibrated images, while many others continue to measure uncalibrated 
images. We have developed a toolbox that can calibrate images using many common 
consumer digital cameras, and for some cameras the images can be converted to 
“animal vision”, to measure how the scene might look to non-humans. Many animals 
can see down into the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, such as most insects, birds, 
reptiles, amphibians, some fish and some mammals, so it is important to measure 
UV when working with these animals. Our toolbox can combine photographs taken 
through multiple colour filters, for example allowing you to combine normal 
photographs with UV photographs and convert to animal vision across their whole 
range of sensitivities.
